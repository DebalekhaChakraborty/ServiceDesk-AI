## Account Access backend

Account Access defaults to the non-executing `AD_ACCOUNT_MODE=off` mode. Use the
repository's existing Microsoft Graph application credentials for real Microsoft
Entra user profile, `accountEnabled`, and enable-account operations:

```ini
AD_ACCOUNT_MODE=graph
```

Graph status reads relevant account metadata directly from `/users/{UPN}`. Microsoft
Graph does not expose a current AD DS lockout boolean on the user resource, so Graph
mode reports lock state as unknown rather than claiming the account is unlocked. A
real AD DS connector is still required for lock inspection and unlock.

The deterministic in-process backend is retained only as a unit-test seam. It has
no environment-driven per-user status lists and must not be used to represent live
directory state. Unlocking never enables an account, and enabling never clears
lockout.
